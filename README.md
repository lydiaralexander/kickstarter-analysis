# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter date to uncover trends
---
Louise would benefit from visualization of the data so that she can see the outcomes of all data. We viewed how successful kickstarter campaigns and found the following information:
- In the US, there were 525 succesful theatre kickstarters.
- In GB, we found there to be only 604 total kickstarter campaigns for plays, but the "theatre" category is the most successful.

Another valuable piece of data identified is the launch date of the campaign.  To help Louise plan her timeline, we looked at successful campaigns and the month of their launch date to determine if one month was more successful. With this data we found the following:
- Successful kickstarter campaigns launched in the month of May had the most successful campaigns compared to all months.
- January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed kickstarters.

Data was reviewed specific to theatre and plays to pinpoint those similar to Louise's vision.
Analysis was finished by taking an unbiased view of the data to make conclusions based on our calculations.  This will allow Louise to make decisions about her campaign with confidence.  We found the following:
- there must be some failed kickstarters with high goals.

Conclusion and Recommendations:
- Due to the high success volume of theatre kickstarters in the US and GB, either location would be a likely success.
- Due to the high success of those kickstarter campaigns launched in May, we recommend that you would launch in that month.
- Many kickstarters seemed to have failed due to the high goals that were set. We recommend that you set realistic goals to have a more successful campaign.
